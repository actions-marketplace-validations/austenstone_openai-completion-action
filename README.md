# OpenAI Completion Action ðŸ¤–
You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it.

For example, if you input
`Write a tagline for an ice cream shop.`, the model will generate a response like `Sweet treats for everyone!`.

## Usage
The action requires: 
- Input called `prompt` which is a string that the model will use to generate a completion.
- [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) as an enviroment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`

To see all other inputs visit [OpenAI Api Reference - Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create)

The output of the action is a JSON string that can be parsed. The resulting JSON object will contain the response. Use `.choices[0].text` to get the first choice's text.

This example is a manual dispatch action that takes the prompt as input and prints out the response:
```yml
name: OpenAI Completion

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      prompt:
        description: The prompt to generate completions for.
        required: true
